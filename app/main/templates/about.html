        iPrice Group report offers insights on daily e-commerce activity in the
        Philippines and Southeast. Statistically, you stand a better chance for
        success if you have some sort of strategic ask in almost everything that
        you do -- in-person, on the phone, over email, or on social media.
        <br />
        <br />

        Think about it: If you make one additional ask per day and convert at
        around 10 percent. Then you have three people each month providing you
        with benefits that you'd have missed otherwise It's essential to make
        sure that your ask relates to some direct path to what you want, whether
        it is revenue, a business relationship or anything else of prime
        importance to you.

        This strategy uses the Ben Franklin Effect: When people do you a favor,
        they are more likely to do another. When you meet someone you yourself
        might be able to assist, ask for their help and, at the same time (e.g.
        in the same conversation) offer yours. And make a point to be of service
        even if others might not be able to help you immediately.
        <br />
        The same goes for phone calls, emails or social media interactions.
        Being afraid to ask for what you want is a detriment to your success and
        prosperity. If you lack this skill, then you need to work on it! Asking
        for help is a form of radical humility, something that with practice
        will have amazing benefits for all involved.Use this study to your
        advantage! Don't just ask people for help -- ask specifically for what
        you,
        <br />
        In order to attract what you want, you actually have to consciously and
        strategically think about what you want and focus in on it. Then, you
        need to take some sort of action using the same four strategies you use
        to ask for help in order to make it happen. You can't get what you want
        sitting around on your couch. You need to put yourself out there and
        stimulate interest in person, via email, by phone and through social
        media.
