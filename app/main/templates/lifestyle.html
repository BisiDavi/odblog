                  iPrice Group report offers insights on
                  <a href="#">daily e-commerce</a> activity in the Philippines
                  and Southeast. Statistically, you stand a better chance for
                  success if you have some sort of strategic ask in almost
                  everything that you do -- in-person, on the phone, over email,
                  or on social media.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Think about it:</strong> If you make one additional
                  ask per day and convert at around 10 percent. Then you have
                  three people each month providing you with benefits that you'd
                  have missed otherwise It's essential to make sure that your
                  ask relates to some direct path to what you want, whether it
                  is revenue, a business relationship or anything else of prime
                  importance to you.
                </p>

                <q>Dreams and dedication are powerful combination</q>

                <p>
                  This strategy uses the Ben Franklin Effect: When people do you
                  a favor, they are more likely to do another. When you meet
                  someone you yourself might be able to assist, ask for their
                  help and, at the same time (e.g. in the same conversation)
                  offer yours. And make a point to be of service even if others
                  might not be able to help you immediately.

                      The same goes for phone calls, emails or social media
                      interactions. Being afraid to ask for what you want is a
                      detriment to your success and prosperity. If you lack this
                      skill, then you need to work on it! Asking for help is a
                      form of <a href="#">radical humility</a>, something that
                      with practice will have amazing benefits for all involved.

                      Use this study to your advantage! Don't just ask people
                      for help -- ask specifically for what you.

                  In order to attract what you want, you actually have to
                  consciously and <a href="#">strategically</a> think about what
                  you want and focus in on it. Then, you need to take some sort
                  of action using the same four strategies you use to ask for
                  help in order to make it happen. You can't get what you want
                  sitting around on your couch. You need to put yourself out
                  there and stimulate interest in person, via email, by phone
                  and through social media.

                  Stimulating interest in person can be powerful, especially if
                  you surround yourself with the right people and the right
                  ideas. A study by Nielsen found that 83 percent of people
                  <a href="#">trust referrals</a> from others they know. If you
                  have a product, service, content or any other value that you
                  provide to others, let them know when you talk in person or
                  over the phone. As an example, if you're working with a
                  charity organization, tell a story about how much money you
                  helped raise for another charity you're affiliated with.
                  <br />
                  If you win an important award in an industry, put it in your
                  email signature or as a tagline in a piece of social content.
                  Showcasing your wins organically and authentically will
                  attract more of the same.
